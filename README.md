Sorting Techniques Project
This project aims to explore and compare various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Shell Sort, Quick Sort, Counting Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. The performance of each algorithm is evaluated in terms of time complexity and efficiency.

Sorting Algorithms
1. Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

2. Shell Sort
Shell Sort is an optimization of Insertion Sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart. The algorithm starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other and progressively reduces the gap between elements to be compared.

3. Quick Sort
Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.

4. Counting Sort
Counting Sort is an integer sorting algorithm that operates by counting the number of occurrences of each element and then placing them in order. It works well for a limited range of non-negative integers.

5. Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as Quick Sort, Heap Sort, or Merge Sort.

6. Selection Sort
Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items that are already in order and an unsorted sublist. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted sublist and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

Performance Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of each sorting algorithm, the project includes measurements of:

Time Complexity: The time required for each algorithm to sort arrays of different sizes.
Space Complexity: The amount of memory space required by each algorithm.
